# good things to know
1. `ls`: list the contents of a directory
2. `cd`: "change directory"
 - `cd .` go to the current directory.
 - `cd ..` go up a directory
 - `cd ~` go home.
 - `cd` without a directory, go home.
3. `vi`, `nano` text editors. `:q` quits vim.
4. `man` the manual.
5. `sudo` do as super-user. USE AT OWN RISK.
6. `ssh` secure shell. Use to connect to servers.
7. `rm` remove a file.
8. `mkdir` make a directory.
9. `cp` copy a file or directory
10. `mv` move a file or directory
11. `git` use Git commands.
12. `less` read a file in the command line.
13. `!!` replaced by previously run command. `!1`, `!2`,... go further back.
14. `cat` output a file to the command line.
15. `echo` print a message.
16. `cmd1 | cmd2` take the output of `cmd1` and put it in `cmd2`. Called piping.
17. `cmd > file` take the output of `cmd` and put it in a file. This replaces everything in the file. `cmd >> file` appends instead of overwriting. 
18. `cmd1 && cmd2` and `cmd1 || cmd2` Logical operations. Do `cmd1` and `cmd2`, or `cmd1` or `cmd2`.
19. `chown` take ownership of a file. Useful if you download something as root.
20. `chmod` make a file executable, among other uses.
21. `touch` create a file. More precisely, update the modification time of a file, or create it if it doesn't exist.
22. `ssh-keygen` generate a new ssh key for passwordless login on remote servers.
23. `wget` download a file from the interwebz.
24. `top`, `htop`, `ps -eax` display process information.

### And now for something a little different.
1. `lolcat` pipe a command into `lolcat` to make the output colorful. Some commands are broken for this.
2. `cowsay` similar to `lolcat`, make a cow say the output.
3. `toilet` make the output in big ASCII letters. Try mixing these three together to get some interesting results.
4. `sl` make a train. A punishment to teach `ls`.
5. `ddate` get the day in a fictional calendar. 
6. `fortune` get a random quote.
7. `neofetch` display system information with a cool logo. Looks nicer than `cat /proc/cpuinfo`.
8. `cmatrix` make it rain digital rain.
