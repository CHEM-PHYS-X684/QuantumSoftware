# Academic Honor System
The Undergraduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university community agrees to abide by states:

>As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times.  I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.

Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code. 

Academic integrity expectations are the same for online classes as they are for in person classes.  We strongly encourage all instructors to discuss the use of technology, and specifically discuss areas we know are problematic temptations for students such as Chegg, CourseHero, and GroupMe to discourage students from using them.  When the semester starts is an appropriate time in addition to providing a kind reminder before exams and assignments about expectations related to these sites.  Please make your students aware that we are able to effectively investigate these incidents.  If you have any questions about these sites or discussing them with your students, please do not hesitate to call our office.  All university policies and procedures apply in any Virginia Tech academic environment, and all students are expected to follow them.
